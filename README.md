# Interface-for-a-database
I created an application that contains a database created in the MySQL database management system and an interface for it. To create the interface between the user and the database, I chose the Java Server Pages (JSP) technology, a technology that facilitates the creation of Web pages, based on HTML, XML or other types of documents.
The application simulates the management of a library. The poets, authors and publications are stored in mySQL, then through the JSP pages you can add, remove or modify the data.
